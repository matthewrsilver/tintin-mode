#no comment only to first semicolon; and not after;
comments #no can begin in the middle; of a line

#no comments can extend across
multiple lines;

#NoP these also work on
multiple lines;

#no	and multiline works with tabs
too;

now onto a few other things....

#no comments {don't} get $other characters\things highlighted inside;

#no
they can run to another line even without a space;

#nop
and also when it's nop;

#no	works with tabs too;

amazingly /* this also works; as a comment */ and /* can work
on multiple lines */ too

/* TODO: c-style commands have issues with $variable and ${variable} overrides though */
/* but matchers like %t and %% are ok */

#no but the different comment types don't */ conflict;
/* TODO: #no nevermind */ I take it back.;

TODO: also worth investigating is relationship between "quoted strings and #no comments";

#nops this isn't a comment;
#no neither is this
